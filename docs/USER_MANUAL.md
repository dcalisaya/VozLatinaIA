Welcome to the **VozLatina AI** User Manual. This guide is designed for content creators, marketers, and anyone who wants to create professional AI videos without getting lost in technical details.

## 🖥️ Interface Tour

VozLatina AI is designed to be simple. Whether you are using the ComfyUI backend or our upcoming Desktop App, the flow is the same.

### The "Magic" Dashboard
1.  **Reference Audio Slot**: Drop a file here (WAV/MP3). This determines *how* the voice sounds.
    *   *Tip*: Use a clear recording without background music.
2.  **Text Input**: Type what you want the avatar to say.
    *   *Limit*: We recommend chunks of 30-60 seconds for best lip-sync accuracy.
3.  **Avatar Image**: Drop a high-resolution portrait (1080x1080 recommended).
    *   *Tip*: Ensure the face is well-lit and looking at the camera.
4.  **Generate Button**: The big button that starts the magic.

## ✍️ Prompt Engineering Guide

Getting the perfect emotion requires a bit of skill. Here is how to direct the AI.

### Controlling Emotion (XTTS)
The AI mimics the *tone* of the reference audio.
*   **For Excitement**: Use a reference audio where the speaker is shouting or energetic.
*   **For Sadness**: Use a reference where the speaker is whispering or speaking slowly.

### Text Formatting
*   **Pauses**: Use ellipses `...` or commas `,` to create natural breaks.
    *   *Example*: "Hola... ¿cómo estás hoy?"
*   **Emphasis**: Capitalize words (sometimes works) or use short, punchy sentences.
*   **Numbers**: Write them out as text for better pronunciation.
    *   *Bad*: "Son las 3pm."
    *   *Good*: "Son las tres de la tarde."
